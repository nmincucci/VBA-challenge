# VBA Challenge

In this activity, I had to create a macro to loop through the stocks for each quarter and create a summary table for each quarter

# Instructions

Create a script to output the following information for each stock:
        Ticker Symbol
        Quarterly Change
        Percentage Change
        Total Volume of Stock

Also, return the stock with the largest percentage increase, largest percentage decrease, and highest volume for each quarter

Also, use conditional formatting to show whether the percentage change was positive or negative
